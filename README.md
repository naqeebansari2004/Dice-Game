## 🎮 How to Play

- **Objective**: Be the first player to accumulate 100 points.
- **Gameplay**:
  - Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
  - Each roll adds the die's value to the player's current score.
  - Rolling a 1 resets the player's current score to 0, and the turn passes to the other player.
  - Players can choose to "Hold" to add their current score to their total score, then pass the turn.
  - The first player to reach or exceed 100 points in their total score wins the game.
